# Questions

## Part 1

### 1. What is a virtual machine?
A VM can run programs and deploy apps (like an OS) but it uses software instead of a physical computer: each VM on one machine get virtal components (RAM, Hard drive, etc) as portions or the physicall hardware.

### 2. Why you chose Debian (over Rocky)?
- Debian is more user-firendly / easier to use
- Debian community (and help to get online) is bigger
- School's computers use Ubuntu, which is based on Debian. And so is my personal computer.

### 3. The basic difference between CentOS and Debian
- CentOS (downstream version of RedHat Entreprise Linux) moved to CentOS (upstream version of RHEL). Rocky was created as ""100% bug-for-bug compatible" with RHEL.
- CentOS/Rocky is for companies / Debian is for individuals

### 4. The purpose of Virtual Machines
- Several VM can work on a single machine: it reduces cost and makes easier maintenance
- Each VM is totally isolated from others: it guaranties security

### 5. `aptitude` vs `apt`

### 6. What is APPArmor?
